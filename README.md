# Webconverger addon for Firefox/Iceweasel

Curated by [Mike Kaply](http://consulting.kaply.com/) [@mikekaply](http://twitter.com/MikeKaply)

The common idea is to limit the Firefox browser to functions for kiosk style
browsing. Limit most Firefox features to convey simplicity, familiarity and
[principle of least
astonishment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).

Used in "Enterprise" deployments, schools, libraries, signs, shops and banks!
