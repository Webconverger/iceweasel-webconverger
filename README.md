# Webconverger addon

The common idea is to limit the Firefox browser to functions for kiosk style
browsing. We aim to limit most features to convey simplicity, familiarity and
[principle of least astonishment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).

There are three chrome flavours of this extension generated by the Makefile.

1. webcnoaddressbar
2. webconverger
3. webcfullscreen

webcnoaddressbar is the common customised option for [Webconverger
purchases](http://webconverger.com/buy). There is no addressbar or search bar,
hence kiosk users are limited to the homepage and what the homepage links to.

Option (2) "webconverger" is the default chrome which has a URL for users to navigate anywhere.

webcfullscreen is for full screen digital signage, for example a this chrome
option combined with a homepage set to a [departure
board](http://traintimes.org.uk/live/PAD) and [noblank](webcfullscreen), would
provide an adequate solution to inform the travelling public at a station.

## Mozilla addons

<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webconverger/> needs to be fixed.

Full time maintainer ideally needed.
